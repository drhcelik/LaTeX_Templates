# LaTeX_Templates

This repository contains LaTeX templates so you can quickly get started without worrying too much about the details.  To get an introduction to using LaTeX for document creation, you can watch my [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjLqM1YYNN4) on the topic.

## Homework Template

The first template is for creating [homework documents](./Template_Homework/) (e.g. if you're a TA).  The only file in this folder is the [_.tex_ file](./Template_Homework/Homework_Template.tex) itself, since I'm not including any figures or references.  You can certainly add that if you'd like, but this is for a super simple homework document.

## Project/Report Template

This next template is for creating a [project or lab report](./Template_Project/), for example.  You'll be able to see how to include a title page, a table of contents, a list of figures and tables, sections, sub-sections, equations, figures, tables, code, references, and a bibliography.  This will give you the best starting point in my opinion.  Included in this repository are the main [_.tex_ file](./Template_Project/Project_Template.tex), the bibliography [_.bib_ file](./Template_Project/JTE_Bib.bib), the folder for [_.png_ files](./Template_Project/Figures_PNG/), and the folder for [_.pdf_ files](./Template_Project/Figures_PDF/).

## DIY BOS Document

For my [DIY BOS YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCUN59x0LF4), I created an accompanying document using LaTeX.  In this repository, I'm including that exact file I used so that you can see what a finished document looks like, and can hopefully run it to get the same output that I do.  This includes the [_.tex_ file](./DIY_BOS_Document/DIY_BOS.tex), the [_.bib_ file](./DIY_BOS_Document/DIY_BOS.bib), and the folder with all the [figures](./DIY_BOS_Document/Figures/).
